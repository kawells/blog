My name is Kevin Wells, and I am a Digital & IT Analyst at Parker Hannifin by day. I've been quickly gathering plenty of IT knowledge over the years. Lucky for you, I'm going to share some of that knowledge with the Internet in a way that is more useful than private repository commits. I plan on sharing my unbelievably wild adventures with automation, PowerShell, Enterprise Content Management (ECM), and Docker.
