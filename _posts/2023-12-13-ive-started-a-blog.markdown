Allow me to introduce myself! My name is Kevin Wells, and I am a Digital & IT Analyst at Parker Hannifin by day. I've been quickly gathering plenty of IT knowledge over the years, and I thought it would be a great time to share some of that knowledge with the Internet in a way that is more useful than private repository commits.

Outside of work, I occasionally freelance doing SEO. However, more often than not, I keep myself busy with automating my home lab setup. I plan on sharing my unbelievably wild adventures with automation, PowerShell, Enterprise Content Management (ECM), and Docker.
